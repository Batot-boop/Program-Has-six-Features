# Three-Different-Games
The first game was played discreetly at my expense, the second game was Number scrabble is played with the list of numbers between 1 and 9. Each player takes
turns picking a number from the list. Once a number has been picked, it cannot be picked
again. If a player has picked three numbers that add up to 15, that player wins the game.
However, if all the numbers are used and no player gets exactly 15, the game is a draw, and the third wasSubtract a square. This is a two-player mathematical game of strategy. It is played by two
people with a pile of coins (or other tokens) between them. The players take turns removing
coins from the pile, always removing a non-zero square number of coins (1, 4, 9, 16, â€¦).
The player who removes the last coin wins.
